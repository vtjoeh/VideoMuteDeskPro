# VideoMuteDeskPro

Version 0.1 
Mutes video for the Desk Pro or DX-series from the touch panel or interface:  
- Video Mute, Video Unmute and Lid Closed is indicated on the screen and touch panel button. 
- At end of call video is automatically unmuted.   
- Muting video before a call allows you to connect with your video muted. 
- VideoMuteDeskPro is not needed for the Room or Board series as there is already a video mute option in the xConfiguration. 
- Sample code only. No warranties.
